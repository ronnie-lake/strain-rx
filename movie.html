						<p class="list__descript">Enter into a world of make-believe and bring along a strain named for one of our favorite fictional heroines. Imbuing its users with creativity, euphoria and a wondrous sense of dreaminess, Cinderella 99 is a sweetly sublime strain for activities that tap the imagination. C99, as it is commonly nicknamed, is predominantly a sativa (at 85% genetic dominance), that reportedly enriches its users with a flurry of excitement and energy. This strain consists of high levels of THC, measuring as high 
as 22%-- which leads to cerebral activation that makes movie watching a deep and immersing experience. Pairing it with 
a fantasy flick is perfect to heighten the richness and involvement in a story of fantasy.</p>

						<p class="list__descript">A couch war you will fight, so, just surrender to it! This commanding, galactical strain is comprised of mostly (70%) indica genetics. Reputed for its potency and complexity in both aromatics, palate profile and effect, the genetic heritage of Yoda’s Brain stems to the legendary OG family. Its intricate characteristics blast off with notes of earthiness, followed 
by a composition of florals, which are then trailed by scents of herbs and spices. Yoda’s Brain is best enjoyed while getting lost in an alternate reality, as it propels you sofa stormtroopers into an all-encompassing body high. With total relief from frazzled nerves and mental anxiety, this is an excellent strain to zone out with and explore the far reaches of distant galaxies and sci-fi planets. Yoda’s Brain is said to pack a powerful punch with effects that last longer than many other strains. 
For this reason, it may be best to choose a longer film or set up for a movie marathon.</p>

						<p class="list__descript">Despite the terror, the muscle tension and possible nightmare-spawning visuals, a horror film is one of cinema’s greatest 
accomplishments. We cringe and cover our eyes, but we cannot look away, nor can we stop watching! So, travel to the Dark Side of the Moon to ease some of that jaw clenching stiffness. Known to help patients dealing with arthritis, cramps, chronic pain as well as various mood disorders, Dark Side of the Moon may just help make those terrifying creatures and scary scenes not only tolerable, but even enjoyable. In addition to its bodily qualities, Dark Side of the Moon is also excellent 
at inspiring thrilling feelings of euphoria, elation and exhilaration-- which may assist in avoiding some of that lingering
eeriness. The strain is said to take effect quickly, so you won’t have to wait for it to catch up with the fast-moving 
and seat-clenching plotline. It may be of great importance to note that Dark Side of The Moon is an Indica, and as such 
is devoid of side-effects like paranoia which could make a scary movie simply unbearable.

						<p class="list__descript">Embark on your next action-packed pictorial with Arctic Blue, a bold hybrid that was synthesized with a 60/40 Indica:Sativa ratio. Born and bred in Alaska by the agronomists of ArcticBlue Farms, Arctic Blue is the progeny of world-famous blueberry strains. The growers’ motive in creating this product was to perpetuate the most desirable trait of the parenting plants:
their intoxicating and robust blueberry scent and taste that are packed with the essence of wilderness. And if ever there 
was a flavor to pair with adrenaline-inducing scenes, this would be it. The bold nugs of Arctic Blue cast a powerful aromatic footprint – as big as a polar bear’s, or bigfoot’s, or some other wild creature that might be the subject of a great adventure we could appreciate better on the big screen with a little Arctic Blue in the pipe. And once this strain is activated in the body, 
it is punctuated by a complete aura of relaxation which may offset the urge to jump out of your seat as you follow the twists and turns of the latest blockbuster.

						<p class="list__descript">The documentary is a genre that aims to educate, enlighten and expose. It raises pulses and opens minds. Proper 
appreciation and enjoyment of a good documentary calls for a harmonious strain that might accommodate such a quest 
for knowledge. We answer such a call with a near pure Indica that’s said to be mentally invigorating and focusing. Critical Kush, dialing in at 90% Indica, is described as being thought provoking and calming, facilitating a better retention 
and deeper processing of incoming information. With mid-level THC content, Critical Kush is excellent for igniting curiosity and inspiring discussion, which is sure to give detail- oriented movie buffs plenty to debate about after the movie is over. Due to the fact that the THC levels are not exceedingly high, Critical Kush will enable the complete enjoyment of a movie without any concern for undesirable side-effects.
